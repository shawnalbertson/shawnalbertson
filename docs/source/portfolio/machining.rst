Machining
=========

After competing in the `12 Hours of Bradbury Mountain <https://www.gearworksproductions.com>` bike race, I found that suspension-setting aluminum chip and bolt had fallen off my bike. While I could have ordered one through a bike shop, I took it upon myself to machine these parts in the shop at Olin.

While it took a couple tries to figure out single point threading on the lathe, it was super satisfying to get it right. I also got to use the shop's Tormach 770M which was an added bonus.
