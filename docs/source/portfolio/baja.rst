Olin BAJA SAE - Team Leadership

I worked on the Olin College BAJA SAE team during my first two years of undergrad to design and build an offroad vehicle for intercollegiate competition. Through this project I gained experience in developing a large scale project over the course of an academic year on a large team. I worked deeply in SOLIDWORKS to develop designs that fit within technical specifications while working within the overall layout of the car as a whole. Moving from the design to manufacture stage of the project helped to show me the logistics and challenges of implementing and integrating so many individual pieces of work.

As a leadership member I helped to manage the team logistically by organizing drive days and making improvements to our test track. I also coached younger members through using CAD and FEA tools to validate structural design decisions where necessary.

I was designed chassis components such as body panels, engine splash guard, and a composite seat. I also oversaw the manufacture of the seat, cutting the 3D mold on our 3-axis router and developing the composite layup.

I was also heavily involved in the manufacturing process, spending lots of time in the shop to help complete production. Specifically, I programmed and machined the lightweighting of this HRC60 gear as part of our drivetrain.

Welding suspension components provided the challenge of holding the workpiece accurately and repeatably. I designed these welding jigs and cut them on our CNC router at Olin to solve this problem.
