URI

I am currently working towards a M.S. in Ocean Engineering at the University of Rhode Island. My current :doc:`uri/research` is on real time phase resolved water wave models to be used for the active control and stabilization of floating offshore wind turbines.

Olin
----
I graduated from Olin College in May 2021 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. During my time there, I was part of two great :doc:`olin/research` teams - one was focused on developing a marine robotic system for monitoring water quality in offshore finfish aquaculture installations, and the other was to develop a lab scale reverse osmosis desalination system. My coursework was filled with :doc:`olin/projects` especially focused on mechanical design, fabrication, and numerical modeling in a team oriented setting. I also took a lot of pride in my :doc:`olin/leadership` roles in which I could serve as a reference and mentor for other students.
