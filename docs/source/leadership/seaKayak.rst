Maine Sea Kayak Guide
======================

In 2017 I received my State of Maine Sea Kayak Guide license. I worked in this role in 2017 and 2018, taking groups on a range of tours spanning from two hours to three nights. I was responsible for planning trip routes, navigating, and teaching about the local environment during the tours. I was also responsible for group safety which meant planning ahead for weather as well as being confident in rescuing others and in my own paddling skills.
