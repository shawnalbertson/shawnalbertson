PPE Manufacturing
==================

During the PPE shortage at beginning of the pandemic I got involved with a community mask making operation. I installed and integrated a laser cutter into the production process which up to that point was done by exclusively by hand. The laser cutter helped us to produce a large amount of pre-cut mask templates which could then be easily sewn at home by volunteers. Over the course of a month we produced more than 5000 individual units which were distributed around our community, keeping people safe in a time of uncertainty.
