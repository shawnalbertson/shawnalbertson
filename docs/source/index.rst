Hello, you've reached Shawn Albertson
=====================================

A combined portfolio and personal documentation. This is a live document which I plan to update 
continuously and use as a personal reference for newly acquired knowledge.

I am currently working towards a M.S. in Ocean Engineering at the University of Rhode Island. 
My current :doc:`/uri/research` is incredibly exciting. 
I am working on real time phase resolved water wave models to be used for the active control and stabilization of floating offshore wind turbines.

Olin College of Engineering
---------------------------
I graduated from Olin College in May 2021 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.
I was a part of two great :doc:`/olin/research` teams which allowed me to establish foundations for long term projects and implement systems in a meaningful context. 
My coursework was filled with :doc:`/olin/projects` that taught me the real challenges which come with implementing projects from conception to completion on a team and with limited resources. 
I also took a lot of pride in my :doc:`/olin/leadership` roles in which I could serve as a mentor and guide for younger students.
