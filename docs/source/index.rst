I am currently working toward a Masters in Ocean Engineering at University of Rhode Island. My research is to develop a phase-resolved real time water wave forecasting tool to use for advanced control of floating systems. I am personally involved with developing the software, electrical, and mechanical tools which uses deterministic wave forecasts to intelligently drive an moving ballast system to stabilize the float. I will complete my work at URI in early 2022 and am seeking employment after I am done.
