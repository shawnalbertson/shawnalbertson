CNC Routing
----------------------

Instructed students on proper use of our school's CNC router, the 3 axis Shopbot. I also worked to support students who needed things cut for their projects, and as a result I indirectly worked on a multitude of other group's projects.

In this position I also maintained the machine and made improvements such as building t-track work holding into the spoil board.

Transport Phenomena
-------------------
For a course on fluid mechanics and heat flow, I held office hours to support students working through homework problems.

Sustainability Synthesis
--------------------------------------
I was a resource to teams working on semester long sustainability projects such as oyster shell recycling and clean energy integration for community housing. Provided teams feedback on reports, presentations, and helped to shape the direction of their work.
