Marine Robotics Research
========================================

During the summer of 2021 I worked on research with Olin prof. Jeff Dusek on a moored profiler for finfish aquaculture installations. The goal of the project was to develop a robotic system which could be deployed on floating finfish cages and used to assess water quality and fish health. I joined into the project as an older student and during the early stages of the project's development. This allowed me to both mentor younger students and help shape the direction of the project itself. 

I felt that it would be crucial to meet with individuals who actually operate fish farms, and coordinated a site visit for our team to an operation in Jonesport, ME. This visit helped our team tremendously by helping us to ground our assumptions in reality and get a better sense of the environment in which our system would be operating. Throughout the entire summer I worked hard to make sure our team was focused on doing something productive and grounded rather than chasing hypotheticals.

Aside from this, I was engaged with mechanical design and physical modeling. We wanted to test a thruster which had been chosen by a previous group interested in the project, which required us to build a test rig for our school's circular tank. I adapted the thruster for underwater operation by designing an SLA printed enclosure and creating a low budget but effective hydrofoil for the submerged towing arm.

I also designed PCB mounts for the robot's computer tube, managing packaging in a tight enclosure, connectors, and cable management through the frame of a submerged device.

Battery storage within the 3" tubes we specified was another design challenge which I took on, aiming for modularity and manufacturability.

By the end of the project, we had developed a fully integrated prototype which successfully operated remotely in our tank. We had also progress towards understanding how the project would fit into the role of an actual fish farm. A significant component of this investigation was the emphasis on deciding who, ultimately, is the intended customer/ user. Finfish installations have a reuputation of being heavy polluters, and scientists as well as the general public would be quite interested in understanding what effect these farms have on water quality, especially increased levels of nitrogen in both the water and sediment below. At the same time, the farm operators who were originally envisioned deploying this system had other interests, especially dissolved oxygen and fish activity during feeding. This process raised as many questions as it answered, and the further we got into it, the more complicated it appeared to be. I find it incredibly motivating to not only develop technology, but also inquire about who is using it, why is it being used, and what types of good and bad will it bring to the world.
