I developed a hydrostatic boat hull model to efficiently simulate boat motions in varying water level profiles. I used gaussian process to pre-calculate righting moments with varying hull angles and water profiles, and then simulated the response of the boat under different input conditions and with different shape profiles. 

.. note::
    This work is simplistic in terms of hydrodynamics, and was completed as an undergraduate before gaining a more complete understanding of concepts such as frequency dependent added mass and added intertia, effects that different degrees of freedom have on each other, wave force models such as Morison's equation, past motions effect on diffraction forces, etc.
