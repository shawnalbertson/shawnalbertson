Gap Year 2016-2017
======================================

I spent a year after high school traveling and getting experiences which weren't academic by nature. I am grateful for these experiences which allowed me to get to know myself in an unstrucured setting. I came out of this year with a deep sense of gratitude for simple things and respect for a wide range of perspectives.

Road trip
---------

In the fall, I spent three months living out of a Subaru Impreza with my friend. Our journey brought us from Maine to British Columbia to Utah and back, where we camped, mountain biked, and hiked our way across the continent. We kept a blog during our journey which `still lives here <https://misticroadtrip.wordpress.com>`.

Outward Bound Semester
----------------------

In the spring, I took part in an 85 day semester program with Outward Bound, which took me to the Florida Keys and both coastal and central Brazil. Going into the program, I expected to learn "hard" skills for living outside, like expedition planning, navigation with compass, rope skills, etc. In many ways this was true, as we completed a range of activities including

* Sailing/ rowing aboard a 30-foot open hulled pulling boat (17 days)
* Two backpacking trips, exclusively off trail in Brazil (7 days, 10 days)
* Canoeing an upper tributary to the Amazon (10 days)
* Rock climbing, canyoneering, white water rescue
* WFR and lifeguard certifications

However, the lessons I took from this trip went far beyond these technical aspects. I was challenged more by living with a group of peers which unlike me had been sent involuntarily to reform their own lives. As the youngest member, I did my best to stay positive in the face of tireless pessimism and tried to lift my group out of their gloom, but found it difficult after so much time and consistency. Despite the outward negativity of this experience, I actually feel more confident now in my ability to gauge group dynamics and support others in times that feel hard. By living out a version of a group which I do *not* want to be, I have learned this lesson even more deeply and carry it with me in any situation I find myself now.
