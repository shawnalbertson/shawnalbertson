**Phase resolved water wave predictions for the active control of floating bodies**

Image something floating in the middle of the ocean. It's probably experiencing a lot of sources of loading, not the least for which waves are responsible. For a floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) especially, the motions that result are of high consequence, as they reduce the overall lifespan of the structure as well as its operational efficiency while its deployed. 

To improve the control of floating structures and FOWTs, we should deploy sensing equipment that allows the structure to consider future disturbances instead of just operating on feedback. This matters even more in inherently irregular disturbances such as ocean surface gravity waves. I am focused on answering the question, **how can we actively control floating structures through the use of phase resolved wave forecasts?**

There are a number of challenges associated with this problem, and I have developed a system which can answer the full breadth of questions in a lab setting. I have implemented surface gravity wave measurement and forecating algorithms which run in real time on hardware for the use of our control system. This system is used to intelligently actuate a moving-ballast mechanism which I designed and fabricated. 


To test our ability to propagate surface wave forms in real time, I work with the URI Narragansett Bay Campus wave tank to create and measure series of irregular waves and actuate my floating structure which reduces the problem to 2D.

My work on the implementation of real time wave forecasting for control was presented at the NAWEA/ WindTECH conference at the University of Delaware in September 2022.
