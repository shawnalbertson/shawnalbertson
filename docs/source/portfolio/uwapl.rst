UW Applied Physics Lab, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Operations
================================================================



As an Ocean Engineer at the University of Washington Applied Physics Lab (UW-APL),
I specialize in the operation, maintenance, and field deployment of autonomous underwater
vehicles (AUVs) for oceanographic research. My work spans the full mission lifecycle —
from pre-deployment engineering and permitting to at-sea operations and post-mission
data analysis — with a foundation in mechanical design and systems integration across
mechanical, electrical, and software domains.

Field Operations
----------------

I operate and maintain a fleet of 10+ **Slocum Gliders** and **Iver UUVs**, accumulating
50+ days of hands-on fieldwork across a range of environments including Dabob Bay,
Sequim, Shilshole, Lake Washington, Monterey, and Guam. As a certified vessel operator
at UW-APL, I direct and pilot support vessel operations required to deploy,
track, and recover vehicles in the field.

Mission planning involves coordinating across research agencies, technical leads, and
field operators to align on objectives and logistics. I manage end-to-end deployment
preparation including permitting, equipment pack-out, at-sea vehicle testing, and
recovery operations. When hardware or data anomalies arise in remote environments under
tight operational timelines, I draw on deep systems knowledge to diagnose and resolve
issues quickly.

Engineering & Integration Projects
-----------------------------------

**AUV Payload Release Mechanism**
    Designed and fabricated the mechanical components of a release mechanism capable of
    dropping a 50 lb robot payload from an active glider platform. The design required
    careful attention to hydrodynamic constraints, load tolerances, and reliable actuation
    in an unforgiving subsea environment.

**Combined Acoustic Backscatter & Microstructure Sensor Integration**
    Integrated a dual-purpose sensor package — measuring both acoustic backscatter and
    turbulent microstructure — onto a single autonomous glider. This project required
    full-stack interfacing across mechanical mounting, electrical connections, and software
    data pipelines to produce a unified, field-ready system.

**Acoustic Localization Payload (×30 Units)**
    Designed a scalable manufacturing build for 30 identical acoustic localization payloads,
    optimizing component selection and assembly process for repeatability and field reliability
    across a distributed sensor network.
